## Chapter 1. Getting Started: the Vehicle's Language

In this chapter we will introduce some basic features of Vehicle as a programming language. We will use the famous ACAS Xu verification challenge,
first introduced by Guy Katz et al in "Reluplex: An Efficient SMT Solver for Verifying -- Deep Neural Networks" (<https://arxiv.org/pdf/1702.01135.pdf>)


### Standard Components of a Verification Problem

In the simplest verification scenario, we will need  a neural network $N : R^m \rightarrow R^n$, and a property of the network we wish to verify. Often, though not always, such property can be formulated based on our understanding of the domain where the neural network is used.
ACAS Xu stands for *Airborne Collision Avoidance System for unmanned  aircraft*. The objective is to analyse the airctaft's position and distance relative to other airctafts and give collision avoidance instructions.

In particular, the following measurements are of importance:
- $\rho$: feet,
- $\theta, \psi$: radians,
- $v_{own}, v_{vint}$: feet per second,
- $\tau$: seconds,  

as the following picture illustrates:

$\theta$ and $\psi$ are measured counter clockwise, and are always in the range $[âˆ’\pi, \pi]$.

Based on this data the neural network is to issue one of the following instructions: 
- Clear-of-Conflict (CoC), 
- weak left, 
- weak right, 
- strong left, 
- strong right.

Given six input parameters, and five instructions, a neural network $N_{AX} : R^6 \rightarrow R^5$ is trained, given the previous historic data. The exact architecture of the neural network , or its training mode are not important at the moment for our argument, and so we will omit this discussion for now. 

The original paper by Guy Katz lists ten properties, but for the sake of the illustration we will just consider the first of them:
* If the intruder is distant and is significantly slower than the ownship, the score of a COC advisory will always be below a certain fixed
threshold. *
