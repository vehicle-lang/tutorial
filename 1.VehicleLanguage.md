## Chapter 1. Getting Started: the Vehicle's Language

In this chapter we will introduce some basic features of Vehicle as a programming language. We will use the famous ACAS Xu verification challenge,
first introduced by Guy Katz et al in "Reluplex: An Efficient SMT Solver for Verifying -- Deep Neural Networks" (<https://arxiv.org/pdf/1702.01135.pdf>)


### Standard Components of a Verification Problem

In the simplest verification scenario, we will need  a neural network $N : R^m \rightarrow R^n$, and a property of the network we wish to verify. Often, though not always, such property can be formulated based on our understanding of the domain where the neural network is used.
ACAS Xu stands for *Airborne Collision Avoidance System for unmanned  aircraft*. The objective is to analyse the airctaft's position and distance relative to other airctafts and give collision avoidance instructions.

In particular, the following measurements are of importance:
- $\rho$: feet **measuring the distance to intruder**,
- $\theta, \psi$: radians **measuring angle of intrusion**,
- $v_{own}, v_{vint}$: feet per second - **the speed of both aircrafts**,
- $\tau$: seconds - **time until loss of vertical separation**  

as the following picture illustrates:

$\theta$ and $\psi$ are measured counter clockwise, and are always in the range $[âˆ’\pi, \pi]$.

Based on this data the neural network is to issue one of the following instructions: 
- Clear-of-Conflict (CoC), 
- weak left, 
- weak right, 
- strong left, 
- strong right.

Given six input parameters, and five instructions, a neural network $N_{AX} : R^6 \rightarrow R^5$ is trained, given the previous historic data. The exact architecture of the neural network , or its training mode are not important at the moment for our argument, and so we will omit this discussion for now. 

The original paper by Guy Katz lists ten properties, but for the sake of the illustration we will just consider the first of them:
*If the intruder is distant and is significantly slower than the ownship, the score of a COC advisory will always be below a certain fixed
threshold.*

### Basic Building Blocks in Vehicle 

#### Types

Unlike many Neural Network verifiers, Vehicle is a typeful language, and each specification file starts with declaring the types.
In the ACAS Xu case, these are

``` 
type InputVector = Vector Rat 6 
type OutputVector = Vector Rat 5
```

-- the types of vectors of rational numbers that the network will be taking as inputs and giving as outputs;
and ofcourse the type of the network itself:

``` 
@network
acasXu : InputVector -> OutputVector
```

The `Vector` type represents a mathematical vector, or in programming terms can be thought of as a fixed-length array. One potentially unusual aspect in Vehicle is that the size of the vector (i.e the number of items it contains) must be known statically at compile time. This allows Vehicle to check for the presence of out-of-bounds errors at compile time rather than run time.

The full type is therefore written as `Vector A n`, which represents the type of vectors with `n` elements of type `A`. For example, `Vector Rat 5` is a vector of length $10$ that contains rational numbers, and `Vector (List Nat) 2` is a vector of length $2$ that contains lists of natural numbers.

**Vehicle** in fact has a comprehensive support for programming with vectors, which we will see later in this tutorial. But the interested reader may go ahead and check the documentation pages for vectors: <https://vehicle-lang.readthedocs.io/en/stable/language/vectors.html>
