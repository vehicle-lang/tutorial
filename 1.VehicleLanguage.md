## Chapter 1. Getting Started: the Vehicle's Language

In this chapter we will introduce some basic features of Vehicle as a programming language. We will use the famous ACAS Xu verification challenge,
first introduced by Guy Katz et al in "Reluplex: An Efficient SMT Solver for Verifying -- Deep Neural Networks" (<https://arxiv.org/pdf/1702.01135.pdf>)
