# Conclusions and Future Directions

The tutorial introduced basic concepts in neural network verification, and thereby introduced Vehicle's architecture:

Vehicle is a tool for the whole life-cycle of a neural network verification property:

* Training
*  Verification
*  Large System Integration

Its possible applications are in proving properties 
of neural networks applied in different domains:

1. Robustness of:
* Intrusion detection systems
* Malware detection systems

2. Sanity of physics simulations:
* Monotonicity
* Conservation laws
* Chatbot systems
* Sensor fusion pipelines

3. Correctness of control systems:
* Autonomous vehicles
* Network traffic balancing
