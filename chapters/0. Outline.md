1. Introduction and Motivation for Vehicle
2. Introduction to Vehicle.
   - A simple semantically meaningful example: The famous ACAS Xu model verification by Katz et al.
   - Introduction of basic syntax and properties.
   - Introduction to building and reusing functions
3. A More Complex Scenario: Reasoning about geometric properties of data
   - Example: MNIST robustness
   - Introduction to concepts of datasets, parameters etc.
4. Property-Driven Training
   -- Example: FMNIST
   -- Generation of Loss Functions with Vehicle
   -- Super-class Robustness
5. Semantically meaningful examples and integration with Agda.
   - Braking example?
   - Vehicle controller?
