# Exporting to Agda

## Motivation

In this chapter, we will look at how to export a Vehicle specification to Agda.
Why is this useful?
In the previous chapters we've been studying about how to verify neural networks in isolation.
However, frequently neural networks are used as a part of a larger program
whose correctness we would also like to verify.
Vehicle is clearly not designed to reason about the correctness of arbitrary programs,
and therefore we need to link to tools that are.
Agda, a powerful interactive theorem prover, is one such tool and by exporting Vehicle
specifications to Agda code we can construct safety proofs for software systems whose
correctness depends on the correctness of a neural network.

## An example

As an example we will use a modified version of the verification problem presented by Boyer, Green and
Moore [@boyer1990use].
In this scenario an autonomous vehicle is travelling along a straight road of width 6 parallel to the x-axis, with a varying cross-wind that blows perpendicular to the x-axis.
The vehicle has an imperfect sensor that it can use to get a (possibly noisy) reading on its position on the y-axis, and can change its velocity on the y-axis in response.
The car’s controller takes in both the current sensor reading and the previous sensor reading and its goal is to keep the car on the road.

Given this, the aim is to prove the following theorem:

*Theorem 1*: assuming that the wind-speed can shift by no more than 1 m/s and
that the sensor is never off by more than 0.25 m then the car will never leave the road.

This safety property is not just a property of the neural network, but is instead a temporal property about the model of the entire system, e.g. the car, the road, the physics of the system.

After analysing the system, it turns out that this theorem will be satisfied
if the car controller $f$ satisfies the property that if the absolute value of the
input sensor readings $x1$ and $x2$ are less than 3.25 then the absolute value of
$f [x1, x2] + 2 * x1 - x2$ should be less than 1.25.

We can encode this property in Vehicle as follows:
```vehicle
type InputVector = Tensor Rat [2]

currentSensor  = 0
previousSensor = 1

@network
controller : InputVector -> Tensor Rat [1]

safeInput : InputVector -> Bool
safeInput x = forall i . -3.25 <= x ! i <= 3.25

safeOutput : InputVector -> Bool
safeOutput x =
  -1.25 < controller x ! 0 + 2 * (x ! currentSensor) - (x ! previousSensor) < 1.25

@property
safe : Bool
safe = forall x . safeInput x => safeOutput x
```

A neural network controller `controller.onnx` can be verified against the specification by running the following command:

```bash
vehicle verify \
  --specification spec.vcl \
  --network controller:controller.onnx \
  --verifier Marabou \
  --cache controller-result
```

where the last argument tells Vehicle where to write out the result of the verification
which will be used by Agda in the next step.

Assuming this property holds, we can export the specification from the cache as follows:

```bash
vehicle export \
  --target Agda \
  --cache controller-result \
  --output WindControllerSpec.agda
```

which will generate an Agda file:

```
{-# OPTIONS --allow-exec #-}

open import Vehicle
open import Vehicle.Utils
open import Vehicle.Data.Tensor
open import Data.Product
open import Data.Integer as ℤ using (ℤ)
open import Data.Rational as ℚ using (ℚ)
open import Data.Fin as Fin using (Fin; #_)
open import Data.List.Base

module WindControllerSpec where

InputVector : Set
InputVector = Tensor ℚ (2 ∷ [])

currentSensor : Fin 2
currentSensor = # 0

previousSensor : Fin 2
previousSensor = # 1

postulate controller : InputVector → Tensor ℚ (1 ∷ [])

SafeInput : InputVector → Set
SafeInput x = ∀ i → ℚ.- (ℤ.+ 13 ℚ./ 4) ℚ.≤ x i × x i ℚ.≤ ℤ.+ 13 ℚ./ 4

SafeOutput : InputVector → Set
SafeOutput x = ℚ.- (ℤ.+ 5 ℚ./ 4) ℚ.< (controller x (# 0) ⊕ (ℤ.+ 2 ℚ./ 1) ℚ.* x currentSensor) ⊖ x previousSensor × (controller x (# 0) ⊕ (ℤ.+ 2 ℚ./ 1) ℚ.* x currentSensor) ⊖ x previousSensor ℚ.< ℤ.+ 5 ℚ./ 4

abstract
  safe : ∀ x → SafeInput x → SafeOutput x
  safe = checkSpecification record
    { verificationFolder   = "examples/windController/verificationResult"
    }
```

This Agda file can then be imported and used by the larger proof of correctness for the whole system.
There is not space to replicate the full proof here, but it can be found [here](https://github.com/vehicle-lang/vehicle/blob/dev/examples/windController/agdaProof/SafetyProof.agda).
