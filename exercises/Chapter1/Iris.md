In order to run the code for the ACAS Xu challenge, please obtain the model and specification from Vehicle main page ([examples section](<https://github.com/vehicle-lang/vehicle/tree/dev/examples/acasXu>)).

The files you find here are for Exercise 1 in Chapter 1:  Your first Vehicle specification.
You are asked to examine a data set and a model, write and verify your own soecification for it.
For this purpose, we propose to take the "Hello World" of machine learning --
